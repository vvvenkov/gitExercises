This repository contains exercises completed as part of the DevOps for Developers module at SoftUni, focused on Git version control, branching strategies, and team collaboration using GitHub.

1. Git Basics & Conflict Resolution
  In this exercise, I practiced:
Cloning remote repositories
Making local changes
Staging and committing files
Pushing changes to GitHub
Handling merge conflicts
Resolving conflicts manually using conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)

The goal was to understand how Git behaves in a multi-developer environment when multiple people modify the same file and how to correctly resolve merge conflicts.

2. Git Branching & Pull Requests – “Towns” Project
   
In this team-based simulation project, we worked with a simple web application called “Towns”, where each team member had a specific role and worked in a separate branch.

Implemented Features:
Editor Role – Implemented functionality to add a new town
Shuffler Role – Implemented functionality to shuffle towns
Styler Role – Improved HTML structure, added CSS styling, and implemented UI effects
Git Workflow Used
Forked repository
Cloned locally
Created feature branches
Committed changes locally
Pushed branches to remote
Created Pull Requests
Reviewed teammates’ code
Resolved merge conflicts
Merged into main
Deleted feature branches after merge
This exercise simulated real-world team collaboration using GitHub.

3. Hotel Reservation SPA – Team Branch Workflow

In this larger exercise, we implemented new features in a Single Page Application using a strict branch-based workflow.

Each feature was developed in a separate branch:
search-form – Search functionality
our-offers-form – Room offers functionality
guest-details-form – Guest information form
confirm-reservation-form – Reservation confirmation page
Workflow Practiced
Creating local feature branches
Setting upstream branches (--set-upstream)
Pushing feature branches
Opening Pull Requests
Requesting code reviews
Resolving conflicts
Approving and merging PRs
Cleaning up merged branches
This project strengthened understanding of:
Feature-based development
Branch isolation
Code review process
Collaborative development
Conflict management
Proper GitHub workflow
